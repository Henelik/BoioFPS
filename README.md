# BoioFPS
This is an open source FPS I made to experiment and have fun with friends.


Requires Unreal Engine 4.19.  At the moment, everything is done using Blueprints, so there is no need for a Visual Studio setup.

TODO:
1. Add weapon switch controls to settings menu (they are currently hardcoded in the player pawn)
2. Allow players to change their names and colors in the "Game" section of the settings menu
3. Create a menu for players to join games by IP (server browser may be added in future)
